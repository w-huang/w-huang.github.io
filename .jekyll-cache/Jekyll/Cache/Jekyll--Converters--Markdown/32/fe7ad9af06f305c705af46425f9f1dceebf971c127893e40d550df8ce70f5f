I"?<p>My friend said something interesting that caught my attention the other day. We were talking about our career choices and plans for the coming few years, which is very natural for people in their 20’s. Specifically, what he mentioned was the <em>sacrifices</em> we would have to make for each possible career we could choose. Now, for some reason, this stuck to me really hard over the next couple of days. For some reason, I had never truly thought about the consequences of success, though I’d understood that success was difficult, and entailed many hard days.</p>
