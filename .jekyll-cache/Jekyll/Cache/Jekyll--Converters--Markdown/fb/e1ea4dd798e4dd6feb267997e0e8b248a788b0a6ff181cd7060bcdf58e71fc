I"ó<p>To start off with, let me first say I am very excited for starting this blog up again. Itâ€™s been 3 years overdue and I think Iâ€™m in a good spot mentally to be doing this kind of thing again. It wonâ€™t be with the same kind of self jack-off righteousness and make-myself-sound-so-driven garbage I was writing before. I hope.</p>

<p>To begin things off, Iâ€™ll leave a note to my future self:</p>

<p>1) Figure out how to package this stupid blog into a docker container or something so that if I ever need to set this up again, then I wonâ€™t have to jump through these hoopsâ€¦ This might be the first time Iâ€™ve tried back-compatibalizing a 3-4 year old project with the latest builds of tooling. Needless to say, it was a humbling experience for your local hackerman. Iâ€™d thought the WSL use at work had helped me out a lot (and Iâ€™m sure it helped me some), but this setup was
definitely way too difficult. I started at around 2am. Itâ€™s now 6:09am.</p>

<p>1.1) Note to self: always check whether youâ€™re installing something locally or globally when using packages on macâ€¦ I just installed two versions of ruby, one via brew and one via ruby version manager (rvm), and they didnâ€™t see each otherâ€™s builds. SO, rvm -v gave 2.6.5, and ruby -v gave 2.6.3, and the gems were all criss crossed looking for each other. It wasnâ€™t a fun time. I actually got halfway into installing GatsbyJS, which is node based, and fortunately for me I gave this Jekyll site
another chance before going down that rabbit hole.</p>

<p>2) Visit some old posts and examples to get a primer on md, so you can format your posts well with the <em>bolds</em> and <strong>italics</strong>.</p>

<p>3) Iâ€™m going to take a different direction with this blog going forward. Iâ€™d like to use it more as a journal so I can look back and reflect on my thoughts in the future. Itâ€™s a difficult balance to find when journaling - you want to write enough so that you have enough to think about when looking back, but you donâ€™t want to write too much either. The fluff really makes it hard to sift through your thoughts well. Maybe a twice per week cadence, or a once per week cadence would work well. Iâ€™d
mainly like to journal my progress towards endeavours in music, health, and career.</p>
