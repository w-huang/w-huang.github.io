I"Î<p>This post will be a reference for how to make links, lists, styles, etc. in markdown.</p>

<p>I got lazy in the middle of writing this post so instead will reference <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">this github link which does the same thing</a></p>

<p>This link will probably break at some point, but I honestly just couldnâ€™t be bothered to make lists and tables JUST for the sake of making lists and tables.</p>
