  <p>I think I need to start storyboarding these posts a little bit more. I came into the writing of this post with too little planned, and it ultimately became a side-tracked spiel about my history with video games.</p>

<p>But that’s not the purpose of this post. The purpose of this post is to briefly explain why I’ve decided to quit video games. By writing down the reasons I want to do something, I solidify my intent in my mind, and I also create a north-star for my journey going forward. I can reference the reasons I wrote, and use them to push through times where I might’ve otherwise relapsed.</p>

<p>So, lets get into it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>My continued practice in getting better at video games will yield no advancements for me in the real world.</li>
  <li>I am limiting my potential by exploring more of a world I’m already so familiar with, as opposed to exploring the stuff I’ve yet to try.</li>
  <li>It is easily a crutch for me to escape the problems of the real world - my work, my stress, my health, can all be distracted by a simple game of TFT.</li>
  <li>The constant gaming has messed up my dopamine receptors, which now find day-to-day interactions too slow paced and boring.</li>
  <li>The decision to quit is an <em>investment</em>, because the suffering is in the short present, but the benefits will be forever.</li>
  <li>As much as video games link me to my friends from highschool, the harder I clutch onto video games I feel the worse my relationships will get. If the soul of such relationships are built on such fragile and passing foundations, there can be no other outcome than collapse. After all, people, preferences, priorities, and hobbies can all change.</li>
</ol>

<p>Next, I like to write out what I plan to do to achieve my goals. I prefer process-oriented goals, rather than results oriented ones.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I will pack my PC upon return to Bellevue. I will instead use my macbook as my primary personal device. To double raise the activation energy of relapsing, I will preemtively delete all my games before packing it up.</li>
  <li>I will unsubscribe from all the gaming-related channels I follow on Reddit and Youtube.</li>
  <li>I will downgrade my internet so gaming is not enjoyable.</li>
  <li>I will replace my desire for gaming with healthier activities that I still enjoy, such as music (violin, saxophone), reading (novels, manga perhaps), and socializing.</li>
  <li>I will prioritize me and my family’s prolonged health and happiness above all.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thats all for now. My next post will detail all the lessons I learned in life through playing video games, as my personal “graduation project” from the hobby.</p>
