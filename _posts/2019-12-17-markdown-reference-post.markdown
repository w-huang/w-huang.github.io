This post will be a reference for how to make links, lists, styles, etc. in markdown.


I got lazy in the middle of writing this post so instead will reference [this github link which does the same thing](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)


This link will probably break at some point, but I honestly just couldn't be bothered to make lists and tables JUST for the sake of making lists and tables.
