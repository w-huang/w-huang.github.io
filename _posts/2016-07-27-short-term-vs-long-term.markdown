Today I want to write down some thoughts on 'motivation' and the short term goal. I dispose/despell the idea that motivation is necessary in self-improvement or success, and expand on the short-term goal that I overlooked for a long time. Let's get into it!

## Motivation.

My thoughts on motivation is that it's bullshit - in the sense that it helps no one get anywhere. Logically, of motivation was a key factor for inspiring change in people, then shouldn't the world be filled with many-times more successful people, sheerly by audience count of motivational speakers? I'll tell you, from first hand experience, that motivational speeches are exactly what they are - extremely motivating. You feel like electricity afterwards, and that you can conquer the world. You go home, research whatever it is you want to do on the internet, and make some phonecalls. Some things go ask you expected, some don't, but that's okay, because you're motivated and you'll push through it.

Two days later, you have a get-together with friends that extends late into the night. "Come for another hour at X's place! It'll be fun!" Sure, why not, you thought, given that it's a Friday and that you've done good work for the week. 

As expected, you wake up around noon-time Saturday feeling hungry and tired. You retreat home and relax, and slowly recuperate from your antics last night. You look at the clock and realize that it's 9pm now. Where did the day go? It's too late to work seriously on the project I was so motivated about now, I can do that tomorrow. It'd be worse if I screwed up my work schedule for Monday. 

Sunday comes along and you realize your house is a mess. I just relaxed yesterday, so of course I'm going to have a messy room today. Work starts again tomorrow so I'll be too tired in the evening - better do it now! You finish cleaning at 3pm, and havent' eaten yet. Time for lunch! 

I could go on with this forever, but I'm sure you get the idea. This story has played out in my life way more times than I'd like to admit. But such is the result of 'motivation': not much. Motivation is but fleeting, and does not push us to improve. 

Honestly, if you take any successful person, and you analyze the amount of time he/she put into his/her profession/career/passion, you'll realize that they are *driven*, not motivated. The successful are the dedicated, driven individuals who can muster their strengths at 5am in the morning to get their workout in while everyone else sleeps. What motivation do you feel at 5am?

Don't be motivated, be driven. Be disciplined, and continue to push yourself **especially** when it's boring, bothersome, and hard. If it was easy, everyone would do it, right?

## The short term goal

This is something I've recently found some enjoyment playing around with. The great thing about the short-term goal is that it enables us to feel accomplishment when we work towards our long-term goals. The key aspect is to ensure your short-term goals are ***QUANTITATIVELY MEASURABLE.*** This is because long-term goals, while important, are often difficult to track. You want to become a professional photographer and you just got into an arts-oriented university with a fantastic photography program. How close are you to your goal? 10% there? 50%? It's impossible to say for sure.

If you instead, use a short-term goal that assists your long-term goal, like "I'm going to spend 3 hours a week of my own time outside of class to practice what we learned." You can track this, and measure how close/far from your short term goal. You can then pivot, adjust, and modify your goals as you see fit. The trick is to keep it measurable so you are working in manageable chunks for yourself. Make sure you push yourself too though!

Personally, I have a long-term goal of getting to the next level of Muay Thai by the next testing season, and then HOPEFULLY a demo fight or amateur fight by the end of the PEY year. However, this isn't helpful in my day-to-day training. I've chosen instead to set incremental, short-term goals on my workout and technique during training. 

A current short-term goal I have is to properly get down the technique of a swing (roundhouse) kick. To achieve this, I will square up with a heavy-bag after every class, and throw 15 orthodox and 15 southpaw swingkicks where technique is as tight as possible. I will focus on technique, and work on power later. 

My ability to accomplish this goal or not will give me insightful improvement feedback on what I need to work on next. If I fail, I will analyze why I failed: poor balance? Do more core-work; not flexible enough? stretch every day; etc. 

As a last note for this section, I want to talk about avoiding the pitfall of erroneous tracking. The point of the measureable short-term goal is that it helps you analyze how you are doing in a certain aspect of your long-term goal. This means that you want to track the **numbers that matter**. Numbers that matter are numbers that you can control. For example, if you're interested in losing weight, your short term goal should NOT be to lose X amount of weight by Y date. This is beyond your control. You need to instead track the number of calories you eat, and check your weight to see if your caloric goals are sufficient. 

## exiting note

To tie the two concepts together, for those wondering how they link together, short-term goals helps you develop discipline and an internal drive to push harder. Stay driven, people!
