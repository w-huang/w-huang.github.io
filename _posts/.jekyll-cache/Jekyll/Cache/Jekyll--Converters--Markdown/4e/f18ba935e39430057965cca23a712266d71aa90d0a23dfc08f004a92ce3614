I"ç<p>My friend said something interesting that caught my attention the other day. We were talking about our career choices and plans for the coming few years, which is very natural for people in their 20â€™s. Specifically, what he mentioned was the <em>sacrifices</em> we would have to make for each possible career we could choose. Now, for some reason, this stuck to me really hard over the next couple of days. For some reason, I had never truly thought about the consequences of success, though Iâ€™d understood that success was difficult, and entailed many hard days.</p>

<p>It was interesting, because Iâ€™ve failed to accomplish a lot of my goals in the past. When thinking about it, I can confidently say that whilst setting my goals, I didnâ€™t realize what I had to sacrifice in order to properly accomplish what Iâ€™d set out to do. I tried to have everything - to have my cake and eat it too. An easy example is that I tried to go on a low-carb diet without understanding that the sacrifices I would have to make are enduring feelings of hunger, many long tiring days, and a general lack of energy throughout. These things are by nature characteristic of the low-carb diet (at least when you start out). Yet, by being unaware that they were sacrifices I had to make, I was constantly looking for ways around the inconveniences that the diet brought. I made excuses to â€œeat carbs on days I exercies,â€ or â€œallow milk because itâ€™s healthy.â€</p>

<p>When you donâ€™t understand the sacrifices you need to make to advance toward you try to find cheats that offset the hard work, pain, and effort required to improve yourself. Yet, if there was truly an easy way around weight loss, why would anyone ever be fat?</p>

<p>Hard work is meant to be hard. You can make it easy on yourself and do easy work, but youâ€™ll also stagnate exactly where you are.</p>

<p>Personally, my goal for the summer was weight loss. Although Iâ€™ve shed some weight off, Iâ€™m nowhere near where Iâ€™d planned to be. So, as of right now, Iâ€™m going to explicitly state what my goals are, and what sacrifices Iâ€™ll be making.</p>

<p>Current Weight: 185.6lb 
Target Weight: 170lb
Time: By the start of December (3 months, 12 weeks. Approx 1.3lb/week)</p>

<p>Fundamentally weight loss is about increasing exercise and decreasing calories. Itâ€™s that simple. There are several sacrifices that Iâ€™ll have to make in order to succeed.</p>

<p>1) Iâ€™ll have to properly track my calories, even though itâ€™s a huge hassle. This means that after every snack or meal, Iâ€™ll have to pull out my phone and properly track the foods that Iâ€™ve eaten.</p>

<p>2) When Iâ€™m out of calories for the day, I MUST REFUSE ALL OFFERS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOOD. Iâ€™ll also have to endure whatever hunger I may have afterwards.</p>

<p>3) There are days where Iâ€™m extremely tired, and will want to eat a ton of food at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. On these days, I will also have to endure the hunger and tiredness.</p>

<p>4) Iâ€™ll also have to spend some time to develop useful eye-ball metrics for food quantities. Such as translating my fist into a number of grams.</p>

<p>5) I will have to endure tiring training days at Muay Thai. I will have to endure tiring days at the gym. I <em>cannot</em> not go.</p>
